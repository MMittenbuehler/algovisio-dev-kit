# AlgoVisio Container

This is a container simulating the environment in which a [AlgoVisio App](https://algovisio.net) runs.

## Getting Started

We recommend that you use our [Create AlgoVisio App](https://github.com/MMittenbuehler/algovisio-dev-kit/packages/create-algovis-app) 
if you want to create a development environment.

### Prerequisites

A package manager like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is required.

``` bash
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Installing

To add this package to your project run:

```
npm install @algovisio/container
```


If you want to edit this project, you first have to clone it to your desktop and then
run in the root directory:

```bash
npm install
```

## Scripts

### `npm run start`

Starts a server hosting the build container on port 3000. You can access it
via [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). It expects a visualization to be hosted
on port 3001.

### `npm run dev`

Like npm run, just that it compiles the code just in time. We recommend to `build` and then `start` instead of using `dev`.

### `npm run build`

Builds the package. It puts the compiled Container in the out folder and the compiled `src` into `dist`.

### `npm run lint`

Runs eslint in auto-fix mode.

### `npm run test`

Currently there are no tests specified :(
